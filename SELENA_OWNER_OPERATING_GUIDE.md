# Selena AI Visibility — owner operating guide

## Deployment mode

Selena deployments must run `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=local` (the Dockerfile default,
also recorded in the operational runbook). The upstream `cloud` mode enables
Stripe billing and a plan picker with the upstream product's own plans and
prices, which do not match the published Selena catalog — never switch a
customer-facing Selena deployment to `cloud` mode.

## Spend guards before approving runs

Two environment variables decide whether the admin queue will let an order be
approved. Both are deliberate stops, not formalities.

`SCHEDULE_MAINTENANCE_ENABLED` must stay `false` on any deployment that runs
commercial orders. Unset means enabled, so the safe state is the explicit one.
While recurring maintenance is on, a commercial order cannot be approved: the
background scheduler and an order-scoped dispatch would both drive provider
calls for the same work, which doubles spend and breaks cardinality.

`SELENA_PROVIDER_BUDGET_USD` is the ceiling for a single order's worst-case
cost, not a wallet balance — no provider balance is ever read. Its job is to
catch a scope typo before the first paid call: an order that suddenly costs ten
times the usual amount cannot be approved. A starting value of `25` leaves
roughly a fourfold margin over the current per-order estimates while still
stopping an order-of-magnitude mistake. Re-tune it against the first real
provider invoice.

Neither variable replaces a hard spend limit configured in the provider
accounts themselves. Set those too: they are the only guard that survives a
failure outside this application.

## Turning measurement on

Execution ships inert and stays inert until two separate decisions are made.

`SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ENABLED=false` is the safe state, and unset means off. The
affirmative values are `1`, `true`, and `yes`; surrounding whitespace is ignored.
Every other value leaves measurement off. While it is off, the worker records
nothing, reads nothing and calls no adapter — a permit queued by mistake is
simply dropped.

`SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ADAPTER=noop` selects which adapter executes a permit. The
name is checked twice: the adapter must be registered in the worker, and it must
be on the owner-approved list in `measurement-execution.ts`. Putting a provider
adapter on that list is the deliberate code change; naming one that is not there
is refused with `SELENA_LIVE_ADAPTER_REQUIRES_OWNER_GO`, so real spend can never
be the side effect of a typo in a variable.

The list currently holds the inert adapters, `openrouter`, and the three Visitor
View surfaces `brightdata-chatgpt`, `brightdata-gemini` and
`brightdata-perplexity`, and `oxylabs-perplexity` — so `brightdata` as a family
name does select a live paid path, and the credentials are the remaining
requirement. `oxylabs-perplexity` belongs to no family: it is the second
Perplexity transport, approved on 2026-09-06 for a canary, and it runs only
when named outright, which is a one-surface scope by construction. While `noop` is
selected every run is recorded as `INVALID`, so an accidental run cannot produce
something that reads like a real measurement.

Spending is metered separately. Each permit holds a reservation in the `measure`
scope before it is claimed and settles when the run reaches a terminal state, so
the ceiling is a running total rather than a per-order guess. A scope nobody
funded refuses every reservation, which means funding it is a step in turning
measurement on, not an afterthought:

```
pnpm -C packages/lib exec tsx scripts/set-provider-spend-budget.ts measure 2
```

`SELENA_EMERGENCY_STOP=1` (also `true` or `yes`, with surrounding whitespace
ignored) blocks execution at the point a provider would be contacted, including
for runs that are already claimed. It is the one stop for
every paid path, not only measurement: the onboarding research call refuses
under it too, because a stop that halts runs while a button keeps calling a
vendor is not a stop.

`SELENA_SUGGEST_LLM` decides whether the onboarding "suggest competitors and
questions" button may spend. Unset is off, and so is any value other than
`free_budget` — the button is free to the customer and is a real LLM round trip
on a live key, so switching it on is a deliberate act with a name attached.
While it is off the server function refuses with `SUGGEST_LLM_NOT_BUDGETED`
before anything is queued, and a job that was already queued refuses in the
worker.

That class is a gate, not a meter. The meter is separate and now exists: the
`suggest` scope has a ceiling stored in the database, and every suggestion
holds budget against it before the model is called, settles what the call cost
afterwards, and gives the hold back if the call produced nothing. Reservations
are serialized per scope, so two requests cannot both pass on the same
remaining balance, and a retry reuses its own reservation rather than taking a
second one.

Set and inspect the ceiling as the owner:

```
pnpm -C packages/lib exec tsx scripts/set-provider-spend-budget.ts suggest 50
pnpm -C packages/lib exec tsx scripts/set-provider-spend-budget.ts suggest
```

An unfunded scope is not an unlimited one: with no ceiling stored, every
reservation is refused with `PROVIDER_SPEND_REFUSED_NO_BUDGET`. The runtime
holds no privilege on the budget table and cannot raise its own limit.

A **pilot invite** is what lets a plan request through free of charge while
there is no online checkout. Each one is a row the owner minted: one plan, one
expiry, spendable once. Issue them from a file so the codes never reach a shell
history or an argument list:

```
pnpm -C packages/lib exec tsx scripts/issue-pilot-invites.ts seats.csv 30
```

with `CODE,planId[,label]` per line. Only the SHA-256 digest is stored, the
runtime can spend a seat but cannot enumerate or mint one, and the code the
customer types is never written to the lead. An unknown, expired, already-spent
or wrong-plan code all read the same from outside. A seat marks the request
free; on its own it starts nothing, because a request is a lead and the paid
order is still built on the desk.

Who may register at all is a separate list: `SELENA_PILOT_SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST` is
the exact addresses invited to the pilot and `SELENA_PILOT_SEAT_CAP` is how many
accounts may exist. Both unset admits nobody, a `*` or `@domain` entry is
dropped rather than honoured, and a guest list longer than the cap is refused as
a configuration error. `SELENA_SELF_SERVE_SIGNUP_ENABLED=true` on its own opens
nothing.

`SELENA_FREE_AUTO_DISPATCH_ENABLED=true` is what changes that, and only for a
request a pilot seat already made free: the customer's own questions from their
own confirmed profile are approved, ordered and queued in one step, and they see
"the measurement has already started" instead of a promise to get back to them.
A paid request is untouched by this and still goes through the desk.

Switch it on only once a Visitor View measurement has actually completed by
hand. Before that the automation would hand the first customer an automated
failure, which is worse than the wait it removes.

Two caps bound it: `SELENA_FREE_AUTO_DISPATCH_MAX_PER_DAY` (default 3, counted
across every account, because a leaked code is used from fresh ones) and
`SELENA_FREE_AUTO_DISPATCH_MAX_PER_PROJECT_PER_DAY` (default 1). A value that
does not parse falls back to the default rather than to no limit, and `0` means
never. A request that hits a cap, or whose measurement fails to start, stays in
the operator inbox as `AUTO_FAILED` or unchanged with the reason in the audit
log — the lead is written before any of this runs and is never lost to it.

Measurement jobs are never scheduled. A run starts from an explicit action on a
specific permit, and a claimed permit is spent: it cannot be retried into a
second provider call.

### Rehearsing a cycle without spending anything

`pnpm -C packages/lib rehearse:selena-stub-cycle` runs a whole cycle against a
local Postgres with no provider behind it: it seeds a project, plans permits the
way an approved order does, executes every one of them, and then checks that the
runs, the mention rows and the cost-ledger rows landed together before printing
the §12 metrics computed over them. It deletes everything it created.

Nothing it writes can be mistaken for a measurement — the model is `stub`, every
charge is zero, and the answers are synthesized from the permit itself. Run it
after any change to extraction, storage or the metrics, and read the numbers as
a proof that the chain is wired, never as evidence about a brand.

The stub adapter is deliberately registered nowhere, so
`SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ADAPTER=stub` in a deployment fails with
`SELENA_ADAPTER_NOT_REGISTERED`: a rehearsal is something you run on purpose
against a scratch database, not a state a live system can drift into.

### Wiring the OpenRouter adapter for API View

The API View measurement adapter is written and tested, but it is registered
nowhere and cannot be selected — turning it on is these five steps, in this
order, and none of them is an environment variable on its own.

1. **Put a hard spend cap on the OpenRouter account itself.** It is the only
   limit that still holds if this application misbehaves.
2. **Supply credentials to the worker**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, plus the model
   the run is sold as — use one of the catalog's API View model ids
   (`apiModelIds` in the contracts package), because a run measures the model
   the customer bought.
3. **Give the adapter its two per-permit reads.** A permit carries ids, not the
   question and not the brand, and the adapter holds no database access on
   purpose. `createSelenaMeasurementResolvers(db)` in
   `packages/lib/src/selena-extraction-context.ts` returns both:
   `resolveScenarioText` and `resolveExtractionContext`. Without the second one
   the run is still stored and still billed, but with no mention, position or
   citation extracted from it — the answer reference is kept, so extraction can
   be re-run later, but no ledger metric moves until it is passed in.
4. **Register the adapter** in `apps/worker/src/jobs/selena-measure.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { createOpenRouterAdapter } from "@workspace/lib/adapters/openrouter";
   import { createSelenaMeasurementResolvers } from "@workspace/lib/selena-extraction-context";

   const resolvers = createSelenaMeasurementResolvers(db);

   const ADAPTERS: MeasurementAdapterRegistry = {
     noop: createNoopMeasurementAdapter(),
     openrouter: createOpenRouterAdapter({
       apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY ?? "",
       model: "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
       fetchImpl: fetch,
       system: "chatgpt_api",
       resolveScenarioText: resolvers.resolveScenarioText,
       resolveExtractionContext: resolvers.resolveExtractionContext,
     }),
   };
   ```

   `system` must be the sold system id the permits were planned with. Evidence
   attributed to any other system is dropped from the ledger rather than stored
   under a name the customer did not buy.

5. **Widen the allowlist**, which is the actual owner gate:
   `assertAdapterAllowed` in
   `packages/selena-visibility-contracts/src/measurement-execution.ts` accepts
   only names listed in `inertMeasurementAdapters`, so `openrouter` has to be
   added there — and the list renamed to what it has then become, an
   owner-approved list rather than an inert one — together with the test that
   pins the gate shut. Registering the adapter without this edit changes
   nothing: the run is refused with `SELENA_LIVE_ADAPTER_REQUIRES_OWNER_GO`.

Only after all five does `SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ADAPTER=openrouter` with
`SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ENABLED=true` start spending.

What the adapter does and does not do, so the first invoice holds no surprises:

- One permit is one request. Requests are sent at `temperature: 0`, because two
  runs of the same scenario have to differ for reasons that are about the AI
  answer, not about sampling.
- Web search is never enabled and no search plugin is sent: API View is the
  model's own knowledge, which is what the catalog sells it as.
- The run row stores a reference to the answer — OpenRouter's generation id, or
  a digest when the response carries none. Storing the answer text alongside it
  is an owner decision taken deliberately (see `docs/selena-visibility/CABINET_MODEL.md`,
  section 4a): competitor and citation analysis reads the answer, and the owner
  chose retained text over extract-at-execution so metrics can be recomputed
  without re-measuring. Retained text is tenant-scoped like every other run
  field, holds the answer body only — never a provider error body, which can
  echo the API key — and carries a retention window the owner sets.
- `costUsd` is the cost OpenRouter reported for that call when it reports one,
  and the coarse local per-run estimate otherwise; `costBasis` says which of the
  two it was. Neither is a billed fact — reconcile against the provider invoice.
- A provider HTTP error is recorded as `PROVIDER_HTTP_<code>` and a transport
  failure as `TRANSPORT_ERROR`, with nothing quoted from the provider: error
  bodies and request errors can echo the API key back, and run rows are read by
  more people than hold the credential.

### Wiring the Bright Data adapters for Visitor View

Visitor View is what the local plan sells: what a person actually sees on
ChatGPT, Gemini and Perplexity. One adapter instance measures one surface, and
the account supplies one collector per surface, so the worker holds three of
them — `brightdata-chatgpt`, `brightdata-gemini`, `brightdata-perplexity`.
A fourth visitor adapter, `oxylabs-perplexity`, measures the same Perplexity
surface through Oxylabs' `perplexity` source and takes `OXYLABS_USERNAME` and
`OXYLABS_PASSWORD` on the worker. It is not part of the `brightdata` family
and no family routes to it: name it directly for a canary, and only for a
scope that sells Perplexity alone. A short, sourceless answer carrying a
sign-up phrase is recorded `PROVIDER_AUTH_WALL` rather than counted as an
answer, so a run that met a wall reads as a failed run and not as a brand that
is invisible.

`BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN` on the worker is the only account-specific value. The
collector ids are defaults in the code because a dataset id names a public
collector rather than a secret; `SELENA_BRIGHTDATA_DATASET_CHATGPT` and its two
siblings override one if a collector is ever replaced, and
`SELENA_BRIGHTDATA_ENDPOINT` overrides the API address.

`SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ADAPTER=brightdata` is the name to set — a **family**, not
an adapter. One plan sells three surfaces, and a single adapter name would send
all three to one of them: the customer would pay for a Gemini answer measured on
ChatGPT, which the executor then refuses as evidence for a system the permit did
not authorize. The family routes per permit instead, from the surface that
permit authorizes. `SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ADAPTER=auto` does the same across both
channels — visitor surfaces to Bright Data, API models to OpenRouter — which is
what the full landscape plan needs, and it requires both credentials.

Naming one adapter directly (`brightdata-chatgpt`) is for a scope that sells
that one surface. Do not use it to "start small" on a three-surface order: a
plain name is not routing, so the Gemini and Perplexity permits are spent on the
ChatGPT collector, and the guard then refuses their answers as evidence for a
system the permit did not authorize. Paid, and no numbers. Set the family.

Every member of a family passes the same owner gate, and the whole family is
checked before a permit is claimed — a family missing one registered adapter is
refused while the permit is still unspent, not after it has been paid for.

### Measuring the owner's own projects on Railway

`pnpm -C apps/worker measure:journal` runs the owner's own projects
through the product's own chain — configuration lock, order, run permits, the
executor, the evidence ledger — from a command instead of the order desk. The
result lands in the same tables a paid measurement writes to, so the report
screens read it like any other.

It exists to get off a CI runner. A runner is billed by the wall clock and
spends nearly all of it idle waiting on a collector: one full pass bought about
ninety cents of answers and cost six dollars of machine time. Railway is already
running and already paid for.

It is not a scheduler. One invocation measures the projects named in one
variable, and it refuses to start without a spend ceiling it checks before the
first request:

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `SELENA_JOURNAL_TENANT` | The organization the projects and evidence belong to |
| `SELENA_JOURNAL_PROJECTS` | Comma-separated slugs, or `all` |
| `SELENA_JOURNAL_MAX_COST_USD` | Refuses to run if the plan would exceed it |

It also needs what any live measurement needs: `DATABASE_URL`,
`BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN`, `SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ENABLED=true` and a
`SELENA_MEASUREMENT_ADAPTER` that reaches a Visitor View collector.

On Railway it runs as its own service. The Dockerfile picks its stage from the
service name — `web`, `worker`, `migrate` and now `measure` — so a service named
anything else fails to build, and a service named `measure` is the job. It runs
once and exits; a second run of the same question set on the same day costs
nothing and says so, because a platform that restarts what exits must not be
able to turn a job into a spending loop. `SELENA_JOURNAL_FORCE=1` repeats it on
purpose; `true` and `yes` are equivalent and surrounding whitespace is ignored.

An active attempt refreshes its database heartbeat before and after each answer.
If a process disappears and the heartbeat remains unchanged for 45 minutes, the
next invocation records the old attempt as `ABANDONED`, audits its recorded runs
and cost, and allocates a new attempt. `HOLD` is different: it means spend is
still ambiguous after an observed failure and remains blocked for owner review.

The question sets live in `packages/lib/src/selena-journal-scenarios.ts` and are
versioned: the version is the prompt family's identity, so changing a question
starts a new series rather than adding rows to the old one. Several versions
read `api-view` because that is the run the set was first minted for; the name
identifies the questions, not the channel, and which channel a measurement used
is on each run row. Renaming them would split one series in two to fix a label.

To run it on a schedule rather than by hand, give the `measure` service a cron
schedule in its Railway settings. A month apart is the useful spacing for a
visibility series, and the same-day guard means a schedule that fires twice
cannot measure twice. A third-party set
may be measured — the answers are public and the cost is ours — but its result
does not reach a public page without that owner's recorded yes, and the script
says so as it runs.

### Applying Railway variable changes

Railway variable edits are staged changes, not live edits to a running
container. The Variables screen can therefore show the proposed value while
the active configuration and every existing deployment still use the previous
value. A redeploy of an old deployment also reuses its image; it is not a
substitute for committing the staged changes.

Use this order for `SELENA_MIGRATION_MAX_INDEX`, `SELENA_JOURNAL_FORCE` and other
operator controls:

1. Confirm the environment and service before editing the value.
2. Open the staged-changes banner on the project canvas and choose **Details**.
3. Verify the old-to-new diff, then choose **Deploy** without holding Alt. Alt
   commits configuration without redeploying the affected service.
4. Wait for the resulting deployment to reach its successful terminal state.
   The previous running container never receives the new value in place.
5. Verify behavior from the new deployment logs. For `migrate`, the
   `prepared ... through index N` line must name the reviewed ceiling before any
   journal or migration result is trusted.

## Before accepting a paid order

- Set package prices in the admin pricing configuration.
- Until real prices and payment activation are supplied, keep checkout in
  `REQUEST_QUOTE` or payment test mode.
- Payment endpoints refuse to record a payment until `SELENA_PAYMENTS_ENABLED`
  is explicitly set to `true`; a recorded test payment moves the order to
  `PAID_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, never directly to `APPROVED`.
- Confirm brand, domain, region, languages, scenarios and expected cardinality.
- Review the configuration lock, quote expiry, budget and provider status.

## During a cycle

Approve the order only after payment verification and the budget/cardinality
preflight. Use one dispatch mechanism at a time. Monitor the emergency stop,
budget thresholds, duplicate dispatch, provider errors and stuck jobs.

## Results

Dashboard, PDF, XLSX and CSV are generated from the same canonical run and
dataset version. Automated findings are marked `AUTOMATED — NOT EXPERT
VERIFIED`; do not present them as ranking, mention or revenue guarantees.

## Current owner gate

Production PostgreSQL plus recoverable backup/PITR must exist before production
boot or rollback can be verified. No DNS, paid infrastructure, live provider
calls or real payment calls are performed by the current release process.
