/**
 * Server-only helpers for the async brand-analysis job.
 *
 * All pg-boss coupling for the onboarding analysis lives here so the server
 * functions that use it stay thin (and free of direct db imports). The web app
 * enqueues the work and then polls the job's result *by request key* — the id
 * of whatever the analysis was started for (an Elmo brand, a Selena project).
 * Callers prove access to that record first, so a job's output never reaches
 * someone outside the org that asked for it.
 *
 * Reading the result goes straight at pg-boss's `pgboss.job` table rather than
 * `getJobById`, because the client polls by brand (not by an opaque job id it
 * has to round-trip). The columns used here (`name`, `data`, `state`,
 * `output`, `created_on`) are stable across the pinned pg-boss v12 line.
