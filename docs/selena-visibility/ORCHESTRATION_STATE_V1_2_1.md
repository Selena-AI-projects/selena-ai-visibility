## Next autonomous actions

1. Commit and push the independently reviewed `0043` static draft without applying it.
2. Implement the deterministic free Maps adapter/stub and runtime interfaces without external calls.
3. Design the aggregate atomic claim/cap transaction as a later migration/runtime slice; keep all providers and feature flags disabled.

## Push/PR side-effect check

- Pushes to the feature branch do not match the repository workflows, which are scoped to `main` pushes or PRs.
- Opening a draft PR to `main` would start Build, E2E, deployment-smoke, license and CLA workflows. Several use Blacksmith runners; billing impact is `UNKNOWN`. Draft PR creation remains deferred until a reviewable milestone and side-effect authority are resolved.

Current owner gate: applying migrations even to disposable PostgreSQL requires a separate explicit command under the repository rules. This does not block further source-only implementation. Paid canary remains a later, separate gate.
