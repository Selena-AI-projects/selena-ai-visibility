 * prove that runs, mention rows and cost rows land together and that the §12
 * metrics compute over them — while nothing it writes can be mistaken for an
 * observation: the model is literally `stub`, the charge is zero against
 * provider `stub`, and the answer reference names the digest of a text this
 * module wrote itself.
 *
 * It is registered nowhere. Selecting `stub` in a deployment fails with
 * SELENA_ADAPTER_NOT_REGISTERED, so a rehearsal is something an owner runs
 * deliberately against a scratch database, never a state a running system can
